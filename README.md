## Tic-Tac-Toe game

Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os (Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a [solved game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solved_game), with a forced draw assuming the best play from both players. Source: [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)
